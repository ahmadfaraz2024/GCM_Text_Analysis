# GCM_Text_Analysis
Diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar, when the body can’t produce enough insulin (Type 1 – 10%) or can’t use the insulin it does make (Type 2 – 90%). In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths in 2019, and with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is a major contributor to mortality from COVID-19. Diabetes cannot be cured, but can be managed. The goal of diabetes management is to reduce A1C levels, which measure the amount of hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) that has glucose attached to it. Glucose levels are usually measured with finger-stick blood glucose tests, but an emerging alternative is use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) which analyzes data from a sensor inserted under the skin. Since CGM is always on, glucose levels can be tracked in real time to see how glucose levels change throughout the day. CGM is usually usedfor type 1 diabetes
